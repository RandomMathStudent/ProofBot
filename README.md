# ProofBot
A passion project designed to explore the idea of a bot able to verify and explore pure mathematics from an approach that differs from the traditional transformer LLM architecture. The idea is that "proper" mathematics should be happening rather than stochastic token sampling



## Motivating question: 
Throughout my years as a pure mathematics/statistics student, I always wondered "What would it take for a machine to come up with a brand new proof in mathematics?". The essence of coming up with new mathematics involves a fundamental understanding of the constituent building blocks of mathematics and being governed by strict guardrails of what you can and cannot do

## The concept: 
The first step before we can even concieve of designing something that can prove new mathematics, should be designing something capable of accurately assessing the validity of a proof. 
We can break down most of mathematics into two entities (apologies if im upsetting any mathematicians here), but the way I see it is we have objects, functions and containers but really containers are a class of objects. 
In a more practical sense, when we think about our ideal framework for how this design ends up working, we should
